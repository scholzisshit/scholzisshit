## 🛠 What I’m Learning

```txt
📘 C++         // getting my hands dirty with logic & memory
🐍 Python      // scripts, automation, and the occasional chaos
🌐 HTML/CSS    // building pretty stuff on the web
⚙️ JavaScript  // adding some life to those static pages
🐧 Linux       // because terminal is the new comfort zone

🧠 My Setup
📦 Arch Linux (btw...)
🎨 Hyprland + Hyde
🎛️ Built for minimal distraction & maximum vibes
🎨 Color palette: Beige, warm gray, soft white
🖥️ WM: Hyprland
💾 File manager: Thunar + scripts
🌐 Browser: Firefox (tweaked, of course)
🪄 Productivity over perfection.
💡 Built it all from scratch because... why not?

🌌 Aesthetic & Vibe
This repo is beige-coded.
Imagine a study desk with sepia notebooks, code scribbled on kraft paper,
a basketball on the floor, and a dream of becoming a polymath.

one of those random sketches you'll find on the last page of my notebook.



🧭 Goals
📚 Become a polymath
💻 Build software that feels like art
🧰 Keep improving my Linux rice
🏀 Master the triple threat — code, design, creativity
